Design-Patterns-In-Python
=========================

This is the git repository containing the files for a book I am writing. 
This book is all about making reusable elements of software design.

While I started to write this as an e-book, I now think the way to do 
this is write a blog post per design pattern and then compile them into 
a guide. These blog posts can be found [here](http://davidcorne.com/category/design-patterns-in-python/)

These patterns will fit roughly into four categories:

* Creational
    * Abstract factory
    * Builder
    * Factory method
    * __Lazy initialization__
    * __Multiton__
    * __Object pool__
    * Prototype
    * __Resource acquisition is initialization__
    * Singleton
* Structural
    * Adapter
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Facade
    * Flyweight
    * __Front Controller__
    * __Module__
    * Proxy
    * __Telescoping constructor__
* Behavioural
    * __Blackboard__
    * Chain of Responsibility
    * Command
    * __Data Caching__
    * Interpreter
    * Iterator
    * Mediator
    * Memento
    * __Null object__
    * Observer (Publish/Subscribe)
    * State
    * __Servant__
    * __Specification__
    * Strategy
    * Template
    * Visitor
* UI Patterns
    * __Model View Presenter__
    * __Model View Controller__
    * __Model View View-Model__
    * __Model View Adapter__
    * __Presentation Abstraction Control__

Patterns in __bold__ are non [gang of four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_of_Four) patterns.
